I assume everyone who get here is familiar with java, and has ability to use maven.

So simply build it and run com.xenoamess.cyan_potion.cyan_potion_demo.ForceEntrance.main, to start the demo.

Notice that I have only tested this (and the engine itself) on windows, so don't feel weird if it broke on other system.

It is tested on Win10-x64/Win10-x86 with AdoptOpenJDK12.

It should be able to run on some different environments but I just have no plan to test it.

Notice that the rpg_module has been started for not long time, it is far from completed.
