A lightweight 2d game engine in java.

----------

After a long period of hesitation, I managed to convince myself to open source most parts of it, yes, even MIT instead of GNU.

This engine is built on the several principles:

    1. completing 2d games in java.
    2. prefer more programmers friendly, not artists friendly.
    3. high freedom + high expandability.
    4. be crazy.

----------

It is still in the process of development, and many places are incomplete.

Many codes related to animation/display have not been completed yet.

The event system is also very rudimentary.

Design of the scripting system has only just begun. (not in this branch)

And no books/documents for the inner logic for now.

----------

If you are still interested in it, you can take a look at [this](https://store.steampowered.com/app/999030/).

I will put an open source demo soon, so no need to buy it, it is put here just for an introduction about what the engine can do.

----------

Notice that this version on github is granted MIT license, mean you can use it free of charge and yes even for commercial use.

However you will also be able to buy a pro license on steam soon.

(

    when I manage to :
    1.managed to get another register fee for steam.
    2.finish the 3rd code refactoring.
    3.managed to finish the modules left (quite some).

)


I can only promise that will be very cheap, so buy it if you want.

~~I need food (and energy drink) for living and further development.~~

Really thankful if you do that.

----------

Also, if there be people who want to contribute codes/ideas/suggestions, feel free to do so.

Please also notice that if I receive your pull request, you will be put in the authors list.

If you want to be put in the licenses folder also, please notice that we accept only MIT license for your pull request.

Add the MIT license to your code piece and put it into into license folder, and write description about it.

And thanks for reading this.
