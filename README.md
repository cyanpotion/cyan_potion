cyan_potion_rpg_module

A lightweight 2d game engine in java.

Introduction
----------
After a long period of hesitation, I managed to convince myself to open source most parts of it, yes, even MIT instead of GNU.

This engine is built on the several principles:

    1. completing 2d games in java.
    2. prefer more programmers friendly, not artists friendly.
    3. high freedom + high expandability.
    4. be crazy.

Current state
----------
It is still in the process of development, and many places are incomplete.

Many codes related to animation/display have not been completed yet.

The event system is also very rudimentary.

Design of the scripting system has only just begun. (not in this branch)

And no books/documents for the inner logic for now.

Demo
----------
Here is the [demo](https://github.com/cyanpotion/cyan_potion/tree/develop/src/demo).

(The demo is actually for cyan_potion_rpg_module, but I guess this counts.)

You can also take a look at [this](https://store.steampowered.com/app/999030/).

----------

Also, if there be people who want to contribute codes/ideas/suggestions, feel free to do so.
