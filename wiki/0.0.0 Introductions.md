# Introductions

cyan_potion is a lightweight 2d game engine in java.

It is still in development, and maybe nobody will use it except me.

It is published with MIT license, means you can use it for free.

It is on maven, so it is easy to get.

It is developed and tested on Windows, and it should work on other platforms(because we use lwjgl), but I have no interest in testing it.
