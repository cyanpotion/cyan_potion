# Modules

There is 3 modules in cyan_potion now.

Notice that considering it is my first time to design a project with such scale, I made many mistakes in it.

One of them is about the modules.

When I begin the project, I simply put everything together, and think I can remember everything, and make sure nothing goes wrong.

Well in fact I'm wrong.

As I realize I should split them, it is already a little late.

Not too late at least.

Now I depart it into 3 modules, cyan_potion_base, cyan_potion_coordinate, and cyan_potion_rpg_module.

Notice that the depart is not completed yet due to some history reasons.

Now at least we can say that we can run lower modules without higher modules.

But there is still some codes that deals with higher modules remains in lower modules.

I will fix them one by one.
