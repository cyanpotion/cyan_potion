When we start the game, we will enter GameEntrance.
If you want to do anything before you start the game,
like editing static values, or startup some components that you added for your game,
you can simply write another class to replace GameEntrance class.

GameEntrance is really simple a class, 
it first use the arguments to build a GameManager.

So what is GameManager?

GameManager is a manager of a game. Each gameManager instance represent a game,
and it holds all information and resources the game owes.

There is allowed to have several GameManager running in same time logically,
but as I haven't meet demands such yet,
I have not tested it fully.

When creating GameManager,
it will call generateArgsMap to split args into argsmap and store it.

Then GameEntrance then make the gameManager startup().

In gameManager.startup(), first we do is to call initSteam().
You shall can go steamworks4j for more details.
Notice that if DataCenter.ALLOW_RUN_WITHOUT_STEAM == true,
even if there be no steam/you don't owe this game, we can still play it.
But if DataCenter.ALLOW_RUN_WITHOUT_STEAM == false, then it will exit.
If you want to change DataCenter.ALLOW_RUN_WITHOUT_STEAM to false,
you shall change it in your own codes,
and be careful to change it before you startup your first gameManager instance.

Then it goes into gameManager.loadGlobalSettings();

First you will enter gameManager.loadSettingFile();
it will lookup "SettingFilePath" in argsMap,
and then load the file using [x8l](https://github.com/cyanpotion/x8l)
then we loop the direct children of root nodes.
if it is textNode or commentNode, then we just ignore it.
if it is contentNode, then we check it must have a name, or ignore it.
(a name of contentNode means its first attribute's key)
then we will find a map using this name in gameManager.dataCenter.
if there be such a map, then gameManager.dataCenter.such map will add the following attribute pairs into the map.
otherwise we ignore it.
If you want to add some logic with the settingFile, you can just override this function.

then we will enter gameManager.readCommonSettings();
we will set some values using the common settings.

then we will enter gameManager.loadKeymap();
we will load keymap from commonSetting file.
we will write more details about keyMap in latter chapters.

then we will enter gameManager.loadText();
we use [multi_language](https://github.com/cyanpotion/multi_language) to load the text file.
then we make sure the language.
the language is set to English by default,
and then if your specify it settingsfile it will change to the value in your settingsfile.
and then if you are with steam it will change to steam's language.
so yes, steam is most powerful.

then we make alive the consoleThread.
that is not in the core, so you can learn about it yourself.

then we enter gameManager.initGameWindow().
